# rexgen

A tool to create words based on regular expressions.

# Requirements

To build rexgen, you'll need the following tools and libs:

| Tool | needed for |
|------|------------|
| flex | Generator for lexical analysis of regular expressions |
| bison | Generator of parser for regular expressions |
| cmake | Creation of Makefiles |
| clang | Compiling the code |

On Ubuntu, you can install these via e.g.

```
sudo apt install flex libbison-dev cmake clang
```

# Building rexgen

Clone the git repository to include the required FindICU:
```
git clone https://github.com/teeshop/rexgen.git
```

Build and install:
```bash
cd rexgen
./install.sh
# you can use the switches -p to enable python support and -l to enable lua support
```

# Architecture

If you are interested in contributing, please have a look at the (Architecture Documentation)[doc/architecture.md]

## Problems

If you have problems building rexgen, you can change to the `build` directory and run `cmake .. && make` manually.
Currently supported options for rexgen's CMakefile are:

* `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug` creates a debug build
* `-DUSE_PYTHON=On` tells cmake to include the python interface
* `-DUSE_LUA=On` tells cmake to include the lua python interface
